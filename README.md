# Gato GraphQL - Site Builder

As the Site Builder project is a work in progress, it has been extracted out from the [Gato GraphQL monorepo](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL) and into its own repo.

This repo simply hosts the packages for the `SiteBuilder` and `Wassup` layers; it doesn't contain the Monorepo Builder configuration files to do development.

If work on these layers resumes, these must be copied back to the Gato GraphQL monorepo.

## Site Builder (WIP)

**Site Builder** is a set of PHP components to build a website using PoP's component-model architecture.

- [Source code](layers/SiteBuilder)

Similar to WordPress, it accepts themes.

- [Wassup](layers/Wassup): theme powering sites [MESYM](https://www.mesym.com) and [TPP Debate](https://my.tppdebate.org)
